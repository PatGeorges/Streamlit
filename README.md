Here is the GitHub setup for a few streamlit applications that I have deployed on streamlit.io.

One needs to include in the GitHub repository: 
1. the streamlit script: app_XXX.py
2. the data (csv, json, html) files
3. the requirements.txt

With this, the deployment on streamlit (https://streamlit.io/) is simple once your streamlit account is linked to your github streamlit repository.
